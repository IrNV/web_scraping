'Yes! It's all vanity, it's all an illusion,

everything c xcept that infinite sky"

At a glitering society party in St Petersburg in 1805, conversations are
dominated by the prospect of war. Terror swiftly engulls the country
as Napoleon's army marches on Russia, and the lives of three young
people are changed for ever. The stories of quixotic Pierre, cynical
Andrey and impetuous Natasha interweave with a huge cast, from
aristocrats and peasants to soldiers and Napoleon himself. In War
and Peace {1863-9}, Tolstoy entwines grand themes - conflict and
love, birth and death, free will and fate - with unforgettable scenes of
nineteenth-century Russia, to create a magnificent epic of human life
in all its imperfection and grandeur.

Anthony Briggs's superb translation combines tiring, accessible prose
with fidelity to Tolstoy's original, while Orlando Figes's afterword dis-
cusses the novel's vast scope and depiction of Russian identity. This
edition also includes appendices, notes, a list of prominent characters
and maps
